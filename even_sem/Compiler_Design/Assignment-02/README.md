1. Learn how to use YACC (several tutorials are available on the Internet.)
Design a grammar to recognise a string of the form AA...ABB...B, i.e. any number of As followed by any number of Bs. Use LEX or YACC to recognise it. Which one is a better option? Change your grammar to recognise strings with equal numbers of As and Bs - now which one is better?


2. Write the lex file and the yacc grammar for an expression calculator. You need to deal with-
    1. binary operators ‘+’, ‘*’, ‘-’;
    2. uniary operator ‘-’;
    3. boolean operators ‘&’, ‘|’
    4. Expressions will contain both integers and floating point numbers (up to 2 decimal places).


    Consider left associativity and operator precedence by order of specification in yacc.


## Simulation Guide

* Head on to the `./src` directory.
* type `cd <directory_name>` to enter into a directory.
* Run `chmod +x *.sh` to set executable permission.
* Run `./run.sh` or whatever the bash filename is, and after the prompt type your input.
* Press `Enter` to view the output.
* You are good to go :") .
