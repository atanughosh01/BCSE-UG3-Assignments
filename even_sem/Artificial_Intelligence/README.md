## Assignments

1. Implement the following uninformed search techniques 
    * Breadth first search 
    * Depth first search
    * Depth limited search 
    * Iterative deepening search
    * Iterative broadening search\
For each of these search techniques output both order and path.\
Work these for-
        - Tree
        - Graph
        - Any puzzle problem

<br>

2. Implement the following :
    * Best first greedy search 
    * A* (A Star)
    * Uniform Cost Search

<br>

3. Implement Hill Climbing (HC) algorithm for function optimization 

4. Implement Simulated Anealing (SA) algorithm for function optimization 

5. Implement Genetic Algorithm (GA) for function optimization 

6. Comparative performance analysis for HC, SA, GA
